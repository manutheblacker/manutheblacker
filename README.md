### Howdy Dev Shawties! 👋

### I'm Emmanuel ADEKPLOVI also called Manu The Blvcker 😎 

## 🧑🏾‍💻 About Me

I'm from Benin Republic 🇧🇯.

I've been doing WordPress plugin development for 7 years now. You can find my contributions on the WordPress repository [here](https://profiles.wordpress.org/homescript).

I've also learned web app development using the Python framework Django. I use it to build personal projects and platforms for a few companies locally. One day, I may release a useful package to the community that helps do something special there.

I learned to build UI using JavaScript languages and frameworks like React, React Native, Svelte (4 & 5), NextJS, SvelteKit, and Tailwind CSS. I'm not a frontend developer at 100%, but I can make sure to provide something pixel-perfect if the project requires it.

## ⚙️ DevOps & Infrastructure

I also enjoy deploying and managing web servers (Linux preferably; I've been using AlmaLinux, Ubuntu, and Debian in production VPS environments recently).
I also know how to configure pipelines to deploy your app to your preferred remote platform using GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and others.

## 🚀 Work & Projects

I'm open to remote jobs that may leverage the different skill sets mentioned here.
In my free time, I work on my side projects that will blow one day under the names Homescript / UltiWP / Tiyalo.

Like it's said in the Radiohead song *There There*:
```

We are accidents waiting to happen

```
I hope you'll come here by accident and discuss your next project.

I would have just said I'm a full-stack developer, but it would not make sense. Some projects have not been shared because a few things inside are private.

I'm waiting for you to get in touch below.
